"""
Generate a synthetic, single-hop test set from a structured Markdown file.

This script leverages the structured nature of Markdown (headings, sections)
to create high-quality, semantically coherent chunks, which in turn produce
a superior test set for RAG evaluation compared to PDF-based generation.

Key Features:
- **Markdown-Optimized**: Uses MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter for intelligent chunking.
- **High Quality**: Generates clear, grammatically correct questions by default.
- **Flexible**: Allows for different query styles (e.g., misspelled) to be
  generated for robustness testing via the `--query-style` argument.

Example usage
-------------
# Generate a high-quality, clean test set from a Markdown file
python -m src.generate_testset_from_markdown \\
    --doc data/sts-student-handbook-clean.md \\
    --size 10

# Generate a test set with deliberately misspelled questions
python -m src.generate_testset_from_markdown \\
    --doc data/sts-student-handbook-clean.md \\
    --size 10 \\
    --query-style misspelled

You are a master of prompt engineering, tasked with generating synthetic data.
Your goal is to generate a question and a corresponding answer based on the provided context, from the perspective of the given student persona.

Your task is to FULLY EMBODY the persona. The question you generate should reflect their specific situation, their emotional state (e.g., anxious, ambitious, confused), and the kind of language they would use. It should sound like a real question a student would ask, not a formal FAQ.

The answer you generate MUST:
- Be found verbatim in the provided text.
- Be concise and directly answer the user's question.
- **If the context contains a relevant URL, you must include the full URL in the answer.**

Do not invent any information. The question should be natural-sounding, but the answer must be grounded truth from the text.
