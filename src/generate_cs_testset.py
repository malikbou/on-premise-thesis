"""
Generate a synthetic, single-hop test set from the Computer Science handbook.

This script is specifically tailored to the structure and content of the UCL CS
Student Handbook in Markdown format. It leverages a deeper heading hierarchy
and filters out irrelevant content to produce a high-quality, relevant test set
for RAG evaluation.

Key Features:
- **Markdown-Optimized**: Uses MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter for intelligent chunking.
- **Content-Aware Filtering**: Removes noisy, irrelevant sections from the handbook.
- **CS-Specific Personas**: Generates questions that reflect the unique concerns
  of computer science students at UCL.

Example usage
-------------
# Generate a high-quality, clean test set from the CS handbook
python -m src.generate_cs_testset \\
    --doc data/cs-handbook-clean.md \\
    --size 10

# Generate a test set with deliberately misspelled questions
python -m src.generate_cs_testset \\
    --doc data/cs-handbook-clean.md \\
    --size 10 \\
    --query-style misspelled

STUDENT_QUERY_INSTRUCTION = """
You are a master of prompt engineering, tasked with generating synthetic data.
Your goal is to generate a question and a corresponding answer based on the provided context, from the perspective of the given student persona.

Your task is to FULLY EMBODY the persona. The question you generate should reflect their specific situation, their emotional state (e.g., anxious, ambitious, confused), and the kind of language they would use. It should sound like a real question a student would ask, not a formal FAQ.

The answer you generate MUST:
- Be found verbatim in the provided text.
- Be concise and directly answer the user's question.
- **If the context contains a relevant URL, you must include the full URL in the answer.**

Do not invent any information. The question should be natural-sounding, but the answer must be grounded truth from the text.

**Critique and Refine Step:**
1. First, generate a draft question based on the persona and context.
2. Then, critique your own question. Does it sound like a real student? Is it too generic? Is it just rephrasing a heading?
3. Refine the question to make it more specific, persona-driven, and natural.

**Examples of BAD questions to AVOID:**
- "What does the section on Personal study time say?"
- "How are students assessed?"
- "What is the information about word counts?"

Your final output should only be the refined question and the answer.
