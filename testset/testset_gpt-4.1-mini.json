As a Department, we were first established in 1921 specialising in history and philosophy of science, with social science approaches being added in more recent years. STS is now unique in the UK in combining \u2013 in one Department \u2013 teaching and research in history and philosophy of science with social studies of science including science policy, public understanding of science and science communication.  During the 2021/22 Academic Session, we celebrated our Centenary and we have collated some of the highlights from our past in the History of STS page on our website.  STS is part of UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MAPS), which is part of UCL School of the Built Environment, Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (BEAMS).   \n  2.2 Explanation of the relationship between department and faculty Your degree is defined by three layers of regulations. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with documents applying to their degrees. These are: \u2022 Regulations set by UCL \u2013 general information is can be found on the Student and Registry Services web page and specific information can be found in the UCL Academic Manual. \u2022 Regulations set by MAPS Faculty. \u2022 Regulations set by STS \u201clocal rules.

      "5 Hours of Study 5.1 Hours of study  In general, both undergraduates and postgraduate students are expected to study 150 hours in total for each 15-credit module. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as lectures, seminars and tutorials, as well as independent study. Teaching events normally take place Monday to Friday between 09.00 and 17.00, although students taking modules outside of STS may find that other departments teach after 17.00. Reading Weeks are not intended as periods of leave from the programme of study. They are purposefully unstructured time in the academic diary, reserved for catching up, reflecting, pursuing related projects, and making substantial progress on assessed coursework. These are not intended to be holidays. 5.2 Personal study time Studying a subject in a module involves much more than class time. Students are expected to make good use of independent reading, independent research, and self-directed study. UCL manages a spectacular range of resources towards these ends. Discuss the possibilities with your personal tutor and module tutors. Also, please explore along your own interests.  Students also are expected to commit considerable time to assessed coursework and preparation for examinations. 5.3 Attendance requirements  5.3.1 Attendance Requirements UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.  Further information:  \u2022 Attendance at UCL 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities  In line with UCL\u2019s obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.

The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help you understand the options open to you.  \u2022 UCL\u2019s Student Support Framework  The Framework includes the following components: Part 1: How to Use this Framework helps you find your way around the different support options open to you. It includes: \u2022 Where to find help and advice  \u2022 Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student) \u2022 Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after your data \u2022 Information on providing supporting evidence \u2022 Links to other support options that are available to you. Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works: Support process: Use this if: What this covers: Delayed Assessment Scheme You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC\u2019s. \nTaught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances \nYou have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence.  \n\u2018Extenuating Circumstances\u2019 (often know as \u2018ECs\u2019) are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access \u2018mitigation\u2019 such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date.   Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions \nYou have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition.  UCL can provide longer-term \u2018Reasonable Adjustments\u2019 to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a \u2018SoRA\u2019 (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL\u2019s Student Support and Wellbeing team."
