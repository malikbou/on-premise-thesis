To those of you returning, welcome back. Your UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future. We want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL\u2019s research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges. I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better. Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience. This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL\u2019s history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL\u2019s bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary. UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible. Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost 2 2 Introduction to the department and parent faculty 2.1 Introduction to the department and its history UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an academic unit for research and teaching made at a \u2018crossroads\u2019 of different disciplinary perspectives. As a Department, we were first established in 1921 specialising in history and philosophy of science, with social science approaches being added in more recent years. STS is now unique in the UK in combining \u2013 in one Department \u2013 teaching and research in history and philosophy of science with social studies of science including science policy, public understanding of science and science communication. During the 2021/22 Academic Session, we celebrated our Centenary and we have collated some of the highlights from our past in the History of STS page on our website. STS is part of UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MAPS), which is part of UCL School of the Built Environment, Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (BEAMS). 2.2 Explanation of the relationship between department and faculty Your degree is defined by three layers of regulations. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with documents applying to their degrees. These are: Regulations set by UCL \u2013 general information is can be found on the Student and Registry Services web page and specific information can be found in the UCL Academic Manual. Regulations set by MAPS Faculty. \u2022 Regulations set by STS \u201clocal rules. These are available in the appendices and on the STS Moodle page. 3 The hierarchy of these rules is simple: UCL rules in the Academic Manual override all rules and regulations set by faculties and departments. Faculty rules override rules set by departments. 2.3 Key staff members within the department and faculty Head of Department Dr Jean-Baptiste Gouyon j.gouyon@ucl.ac.uk Department Manager Giuseppe La Rosa sts-dm@ucl.ac.uk Director of Education & Student Experience Francesca Scott francesca.scott@ucl.ac.uk Faculty Student Experience Officer Sophia MacBlain s.macblain@ucl.ac.uk 4 3 Departmental staff related to the programme 3.1 Explanation to students of the roles of module and programme leaders and other key staff involved in programme delivery Role Person Email Director of Education UG Careers Officer Professor Joe Cain j.cain@ucl.ac.uk Undergraduate Programme Tutor Dr Charlotte Sleigh c.sleigh@ucl.ac.uk MSc History and Philosophy of Science & MSc Science, Technology and Society Programme Tutor Dr Rory Jubber rory.jubber@ucl.ac.uk MSc Science Communication Programme Tutor Professor Melanie Smallman m.smallman@ucl.ac.uk iBSc Programmes Tutor Dr Erman S\u00f6z\u00fcdo\u011fru erman.sozudogru@ucl.ac.uk Affiliate Student Tutor Dr Michel Wahome m.wahome@ucl.ac.uk Student Success Adviser Tekla Palladino t.palladino@ucl.ac.uk Teaching Administrator Randalle Roberts sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk 5 4 Key dates 4.1 Term dates, exam/assessment period, core activities 4.1.1 UCL Term Dates: 2024/25 Term Dates First Term Monday 23 September 2024 to Friday 13 December 2024 Second Term Monday 13 January 2025 to Friday 28 March 2025 Third Term Monday 28 April 2025 to Friday 13 June 2025 For those departments that operate them, Reading Weeks are the weeks beginning Monday 4 November 2024 and Monday 17 February 2025.

      "will take place from 29 April until 30 May 2025. The examination timetable is published via Portico (the Student Information system), usually in late February. Students will receive an email from Student Registry Services (Exams) asking you to confirm that you have been registered for the correct modules and the correct exams. It is essential that you check your personal timetable to ensure that you are entered for the correct examinations. STS students who require special examination arrangements, (i.e., students with conditions such as dyslexia, visual impairment, or other medical conditions) may request reasonable adjustments to complete an exam. The process for students to apply for 6 these arrangements is usually communicated during term 2, although students can apply for reasonable adjustments at any point after they have enrolled. 4.2 Department- and faculty-level events and key dates Key dates for HPSC modules are posted in the module syllabus and, normally, on the module\u2019s Moodle page. Key dates for the department are posted on the STS website and are advertised to students via UCL email address and via STS social media. STS run a comprehensive programme of seminars and events, which are widely publicised on social media and through departmental channels. All STS students are invited to attend. 4.3 How UCL and the department will communicate with students UCL will communicate with students via: \u00a7 UCL student email \u2013 Students should check their UCL email regularly. UCL student email \u00a7 UCL Moodle \u2013 UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. UCL Moodle \u00a7 myUCL \u2013 A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities. myUCL \u00a7 UCL Instagram \u2013 UCL\u2019s official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community. UCL Instagram \u00a7 X.com/ucl - Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL\u2019s diverse community. X.com/ucl The department will communicate with students via UCL student email and UCL Moodle. STS also has a social media presence @STSUCL X.com channel, STSUCL Facebook page, STS Instagram and STS YouTube channel. 7 5 Hours of Study 5.1 Hours of study In general, both undergraduates and postgraduate students are expected to study 150 hours in total for each 15-credit module. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as lectures, seminars and tutorials, as well as independent study. Teaching events normally take place Monday to Friday between 09.00 and 17.00, although students taking modules outside of STS may find that other departments teach after 17.00. Reading Weeks are not intended as periods of leave from the programme of study. They are purposefully unstructured time in the academic diary, reserved for catching up, reflecting, pursuing related projects, and making substantial progress on assessed coursework. These are not intended to be holidays. 5.2 Personal study time Studying a subject in a module involves much more than class time. Students are expected to make good use of independent reading, independent research, and self- directed study. UCL manages a spectacular range of resources towards these ends. Discuss the possibilities with your personal tutor and module tutors. Also, please explore along your own interests. Students also are expected to commit considerable time to assessed coursework and preparation for examinations. 5.3 Attendance requirements 5.3.1 Attendance Requirements UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials. Further information: Attendance at UCL 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities In line with UCL\u2019s obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student. Further information: Student visa responsibilities Attendance at UCL 8 6 Our expectations of students 6.1 UCL Code of Conduct UCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith and cultural background and the first to admit women. UCL expects its members to refrain from interfering with the proper functioning or activities of UCL, or of those who work or study at UCL. Students should ensure they read and familiarise themselves with UCL\u2019s Student Code of Conduct and other related policies and should be aware that any inappropriate behaviour may lead to actions under UCL\u2019s Student Disciplinary Procedures.

The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help you understand the options open to you. UCL\u2019s Student Support Framework The Framework includes the following components: Part 1: How to Use this Framework helps you find your way around the different support options open to you.

      "following processes works: Support process: Use this if: What this covers: Delayed Assessment Scheme You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC\u2019s. Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence. \u2018Extenuating Circumstances\u2019 (often know as \u2018ECs\u2019) are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access \u2018mitigation\u2019 such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition. UCL can provide longer-term \u2018Reasonable Adjustments\u2019 to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a \u2018SoRA\u2019 (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL\u2019s Student Support and Wellbeing team. 10 Support process: Academic Adjustments Exam Adjustments Interruption of Study Support to Study Use this if: You need long-term or ongoing support with one or more of the following: You or your partner is pregnant or planning maternity, paternity or adoption leave You are a parent or carer \u2022 You observe religious beliefs or cultural customs You are affected by any form of harassment or discrimination You are affected by traumatic world events such as war or terrorism You are a critical worker (e.g. NHS staff). You need additional support to sit an online or face-to-face exam. You are thinking of taking time out from your studies . You are having persistent or ongoing difficulties and UCL\u2019s other support processes are not providing the right level of help. 11 What this covers: Academic Adjustments include long- term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need additional support with learning, teaching and assessment. Exam Adjustments are specifically for Controlled Condition Exams and Take- Home Papers, and include adjustments such as extra time, rest breaks, a more comfortable chair and specialist equipment. These are available to students with a longer-term disability or health condition, and to students who need shorter-term support e.g. if you are pregnant, or have a broken arm. Interruption of Study is for students who wish to take a break from their studies and return at a later date. You can take time out from your studies for a wide range of reasons - you might want to take up an internship or placement, take time out to travel, be planning to have children, or be facing personal challenges which are making it hard to study. Support to Study aims to help you if you are having significant, persistent, longer- term difficulties and UCL\u2019s normal mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable Adjustments, Extenuating Circumstances, Interruption of Study) are not providing enough support. We will work with you to put together a Support Plan to help you get the most out of your studies. The Student Support Framework is just one of the ways in which UCL helps you to get the most out of your time with us: The Student Support Framework Your Personal Tutor Your Department The Student Support Framework explains how you can apply for formal support with your studies such as extensions, reasonable adjustments, or taking time out from your studies. One of your first priorities should be to meet your Personal Tutor. They will help you to get the most out of your studies, and provide support and encouragement during your time with us. Help is also available from members of staff in your UCL department including academic staff and departmental administrators. You can find their contact details on Moodle or in your Student Handbook. UCL Student Support and Wellbeing FAQs and Enquiries Students\u2019 Union UCL Advice Service UCL\u2019s team of expert wellbeing, disability and mental health staff provide a safe, confidential and non- judgemental space in which you can discuss any issues that may be affecting your ability to study. askUCL is our self-help centre and student enquiry system. It includes a wide range of Frequently Asked Questions. If you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, you can log an enquiry.

      "unavailable during the normal course of study, STS programme tutors will consider substitutions and are the official source for approving these substitutions. The main criterion for substitution is that the result maintains a coherent programme of study within the degree title. 8.2 Projects, placements and study abroad ( 8.2.1 Information on study abroad options Students may have the option of study abroad in Year 3 of the degree. Please note that the opportunity to apply for or secure a place on a year abroad is not guaranteed. This will depend on whether UCL can put in place appropriate arrangements for study abroad with a suitable partner institution. The list of partner institutions abroad that you may be able to apply for will be made available in the Autumn Term of your second year of study at UCL. If there is an opportunity to apply for a year abroad, the success of your application will depend on the number of study abroad places available at the relevant partner institution, your academic standing and the strength of your study abroad application, which will set out your motivations for studying abroad and your reasons for applying for your preferred universities abroad. If a year is spent abroad in your third year, then you will return to UCL for an additional fourth year of your UCL programme. In such event your three-year UCL programme would automatically become a four-year programme. Further information: Go Abroad \u2022 STS Study Abroad Tutor: Dr Simon Lock \u2013 simon.lock@ucl.ac.uk 8.2.2 Information on summer internships STS has a summer studentship programme, which supports students working with STS academics on research projects directly related to their research programmes. These opportunities are circulated in the Spring, and STS students will be encouraged to apply. 8.2.3 Information on internships from UCL Careers UCL has web resources, a student toolkit and bookable appointments for students to support them with applications for internships, and guidance in sourcing opportunities. 13 Further information: Internships 9 Tutorials and supervision 9.1 What students can expect in terms of academic and personal tutoring Academic and Personal Tutoring UCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community. As part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support. At the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure you reply to emails from your personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if you can\u2019t attend a meeting. It\u2019s important to build a relationship with your tutor so that you feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. Your personal tutor can also provide academic references for you, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them. STS prides itself on our personal tutoring system. Personal tutors are members of academic staff trained to provide tailored academic advice (related to degrees and university). They know about resources available elsewhere in UCL for support. This includes physical and mental health, careers, rights and advice, and financial assistance. UCL also is well-supported with academic and welfare teams for students in need. Make the most of this relationship by meeting with your personal tutor on a regular basis. We will invite you to termly meetings but take the initiative and ask for more if that suits your needs. Meet monthly, for instance. Keep the conversation moving. Help your personal tutor get to know you, your academic work and your aspirations. Personal tutors are most effective when kept in conversation. Further information: Personal Tutors 9.2 Transition Mentors (first-year undergraduate students only) 9.2.1 Transition Mentors The UCL Transition Programme supports new first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for their first term. Transition mentors are later-year students within each department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle in to UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme. First-year students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at their department\u2019s \u2018Meet your Mentor\u2019 session.

First year undergraduate students do not need to make module selections as the first year of the programme consists of 8 compulsory modules. Returning students will have made their module selections in Term 2 of the preceding academic year. The options for students are outlined in our module catalogue. The department suggests that a total of four modules should be taken each term. Changes to your initial selection are possible, but this must be done as soon as possible and by the relevant deadline. STS students should discuss their module selections with their personal tutor. For new students, this discussion should be had at the end of induction week when personal tutor meetings will be scheduled. Students wishing to register on modules not run in STS normally need to secure permission from the department delivering the module. Students are advised to confirm that the module(s) they wish to take are open to students from other departments and that they satisfy any pre-requisites. Each module entry in the UCL module catalogue should have information on this but you are advised to contact the department if this is unclear. 10.1.2 Process for Choosing Modules for 2025/26 (continuing"

Students should also ensure that they read the relevant sections of the UCL Academic Manual before making any requests to change their academic record. Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change. 11.1.1 Changing programme If a student wishes to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, they must make a formal application. The usual deadline for change of degree programme during the academic session is the end of October each year (for students registering in September, with a later date for students registering in January) to be compatible with module selection deadlines, although later transfers may be possible, where the transfer does not affect module selections. Students should log in to their Portico account and complete the online application. Students are strongly advised to discuss their plan with the departments involved before requesting a change of programme on Portico.

The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption. To inform the SLC of a change in your student status, a Change of Circumstance (CoC) form must be completed online by your Faculty.

To those of you returning, welcome back. Your UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future. We want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL\u2019s research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges. I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better. Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience. This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL\u2019s history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL\u2019s bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary. UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible. Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost 2 2 Introduction to the department and parent faculty 2.1 Introduction to the department and its history UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an academic unit for research and teaching made at a \u2018crossroads\u2019 of different disciplinary perspectives. As a Department, we were first established in 1921 specialising in history and philosophy of science, with social science approaches being added in more recent years. STS is now unique in the UK in combining \u2013 in one Department \u2013 teaching and research in history and philosophy of science with social studies of science including science policy, public understanding of science and science communication. During the 2021/22 Academic Session, we celebrated our Centenary and we have collated some of the highlights from our past in the History of STS page on our website. STS is part of UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MAPS), which is part of UCL School of the Built Environment, Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (BEAMS). 2.2 Explanation of the relationship between department and faculty Your degree is defined by three layers of regulations. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with documents applying to their degrees. These are: Regulations set by UCL \u2013 general information is can be found on the Student and Registry Services web page and specific information can be found in the UCL Academic Manual. Regulations set by MAPS Faculty. \u2022 Regulations set by STS \u201clocal rules. These are available in the appendices and on the STS Moodle page. 3 The hierarchy of these rules is simple: UCL rules in the Academic Manual override all rules and regulations set by faculties and departments. Faculty rules override rules set by departments. 2.3 Key staff members within the department and faculty Head of Department Dr Jean-Baptiste Gouyon j.gouyon@ucl.ac.uk Department Manager Giuseppe La Rosa sts-dm@ucl.ac.uk Director of Education & Student Experience Francesca Scott francesca.scott@ucl.ac.uk Faculty Student Experience Officer Sophia MacBlain s.macblain@ucl.ac.uk 4 3 Departmental staff related to the programme 3.1 Explanation to students of the roles of module and programme leaders and other key staff involved in programme delivery Role Person Email Director of Education UG Careers Officer Professor Joe Cain j.cain@ucl.ac.uk Undergraduate Programme Tutor Dr Charlotte Sleigh c.sleigh@ucl.ac.uk MSc History and Philosophy of Science & MSc Science, Technology and Society Programme Tutor Dr Rory Jubber rory.jubber@ucl.ac.uk MSc Science Communication Programme Tutor Professor Melanie Smallman m.smallman@ucl.ac.uk iBSc Programmes Tutor Dr Erman S\u00f6z\u00fcdo\u011fru erman.sozudogru@ucl.ac.uk Affiliate Student Tutor Dr Michel Wahome m.wahome@ucl.ac.uk Student Success Adviser Tekla Palladino t.palladino@ucl.ac.uk Teaching Administrator Randalle Roberts sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk 5 4 Key dates 4.1 Term dates, exam/assessment period, core activities 4.1.1 UCL Term Dates: 2024/25 Term Dates First Term Monday 23 September 2024 to Friday 13 December 2024 Second Term Monday 13 January 2025 to Friday 28 March 2025 Third Term Monday 28 April 2025 to Friday 13 June 2025 For those departments that operate them, Reading Weeks are the weeks beginning Monday 4 November 2024 and Monday 17 February 2025.

Students should also ensure that they read the relevant sections of the UCL Academic Manual before making any requests to change their academic record. Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change. 11.1.1 Changing programme If a student wishes to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, they must make a formal application. The usual deadline for change of degree programme during the academic session is the end of October each year (for students registering in September, with a later date for students registering in January) to be compatible with module selection deadlines, although later transfers may be possible, where the transfer does not affect module selections. Students should log in to their Portico account and complete the online application. Students are strongly advised to discuss their plan with the departments involved before requesting a change of programme on Portico. Further information: Changing your degree programme or modules Academic Manual Chapter 3, Section 5 Programme Transfers 11.1.2 Withdrawing from a programme If a student wishes to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final examinations they must apply for a formal withdrawal from their studies. Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change. Students should log in to their Portico account and complete the online application. Further information: Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies Academic Manual Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme 11.1.3 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to your student status If a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption. To inform the SLC of a change in your student status, a Change of Circumstance (CoC) form must be completed online by your Faculty. See the Key Contacts section for details 17 of who to contact in the Faculty if you require a CoC form to be submitted on your behalf or if you have any related queries. 11.2 Key contacts in the department and faculty for assistance with any of the above Role Person Email Undergraduate Programme Tutor Dr Charlotte Sleigh c.sleigh@ucl.ac.uk MSc History and Philosophy of Science & MSc Science, Technology and Society Programme Tutor Dr Rory Jubber rory.jubber@ucl.ac.uk MSc Science Communication Programme Tutor Professor Melanie Smallman m.smallman@ucl.ac.uk iBSc Programmes Tutor Dr Erman S\u00f6z\u00fcdo\u011fru erman.sozudogru@ucl.ac.uk Affiliate Student Tutor Dr Michel Wahome m.wahome@ucl.ac.uk Student Success Advisor (year 1 undergraduate students) Tekla Palladino t.palladino@ucl.ac.uk Teaching Administrator Randalle Roberts sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk 18 12 Progression, Award and Classification 12.1 Information on how a student progresses through the programme \u2013 what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree, what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress UCL\u2019s Progression and Award Requirements define how many credits and modules students need to pass to progress from one year of study to the next and to be awarded a UCL qualification.

Students will receive an email from Student Registry Services (Exams) asking you to confirm that you have been registered for the correct modules and the correct exams. It is essential that you check your personal timetable to ensure that you are entered for the correct examinations. STS students who require special examination arrangements, (i.e., students with conditions such as dyslexia, visual impairment, or other medical conditions) may request reasonable adjustments to complete an exam. The process for students to apply for 6 these arrangements is usually communicated during term 2, although students can apply for reasonable adjustments at any point after they have enrolled. 4.2 Department- and faculty-level events and key dates Key dates for HPSC modules are posted in the module syllabus and, normally, on the module\u2019s Moodle page. Key dates for the department are posted on the STS website and are advertised to students via UCL email address and via STS social media. STS run a comprehensive programme of seminars and events, which are widely publicised on social media and through departmental channels. All STS students are invited to attend. 4.3 How UCL and the department will communicate with students UCL will communicate with students via: \u00a7 UCL student email \u2013 Students should check their UCL email regularly. UCL student email \u00a7 UCL Moodle \u2013 UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources.

X.com/ucl The department will communicate with students via UCL student email and UCL Moodle. STS also has a social media presence @STSUCL X.com channel, STSUCL Facebook page, STS Instagram and STS YouTube channel. 7 5 Hours of Study 5.1 Hours of study In general, both undergraduates and postgraduate students are expected to study 150 hours in total for each 15-credit module. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as lectures, seminars and tutorials, as well as independent study. Teaching events normally take place Monday to Friday between 09.00 and 17.00, although students taking modules outside of STS may find that other departments teach after 17.00. Reading Weeks are not intended as periods of leave from the programme of study. They are purposefully unstructured time in the academic diary, reserved for catching up, reflecting, pursuing related projects, and making substantial progress on assessed coursework. These are not intended to be holidays. 5.2 Personal study time Studying a subject in a module involves much more than class time. Students are expected to make good use of independent reading, independent research, and self- directed study. UCL manages a spectacular range of resources towards these ends. Discuss the possibilities with your personal tutor and module tutors. Also, please explore along your own interests. Students also are expected to commit considerable time to assessed coursework and preparation for examinations. 5.3 Attendance requirements 5.3.1 Attendance Requirements UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials. Further information: Attendance at UCL 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities In line with UCL\u2019s obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student. Further information: Student visa responsibilities Attendance at UCL 8 6 Our expectations of students 6.1 UCL Code of Conduct UCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith and cultural background and the first to admit women.

Further information: Students\u2019 Union UCL Advice Service Advice Service Contact Form 17.7 Informal and Formal Student Complaints 17.7.1 Student Complaints UCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL. However we recognise that from time to time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided. 17.7.2 Informal resolution Many complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students\u2019 Union\u2019s Advice Service. UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint. 17.7.3 Formal complaints If an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL\u2019s Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation. The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions. Students\u2019 attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.

We value students\u2019 feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space \u2013 including 1000 in the 24 hour new Student Centre, we\u2019ve focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. 18.2 Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS,) Annual Programme Evaluations and New to UCL survey Student Surveys One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it\u2019s about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL \u2013 including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence. Further information: You Shape UCL 18.3 Module Dialogue \u2013 what is it and why it\u2019s important Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff \u2018check-in\u2019 with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students. 18.4 UCL ChangeMakers UCL ChangeMakers helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL: Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students\u2019 experience at UCL. Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff. 42 \u2022 Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend. There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2. Projects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes). Further information: UCL ChangeMakers 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers Student Quality Reviewers, where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.

UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible. Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost 2 2 Introduction to the department and parent faculty 2.1 Introduction to the department and its history UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an academic unit for research and teaching made at a \u2018crossroads\u2019 of different disciplinary perspectives. As a Department, we were first established in 1921 specialising in history and philosophy of science, with social science approaches being added in more recent years. STS is now unique in the UK in combining \u2013 in one Department \u2013 teaching and research in history and philosophy of science with social studies of science including science policy, public understanding of science and science communication. During the 2021/22 Academic Session, we celebrated our Centenary and we have collated some of the highlights from our past in the History of STS page on our website. STS is part of UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MAPS), which is part of UCL School of the Built Environment, Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (BEAMS). 2.2 Explanation of the relationship between department and faculty Your degree is defined by three layers of regulations. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with documents applying to their degrees. These are: Regulations set by UCL \u2013 general information is can be found on the Student and Registry Services web page and specific information can be found in the UCL Academic Manual. Regulations set by MAPS Faculty. \u2022 Regulations set by STS \u201clocal rules. These are available in the appendices and on the STS Moodle page. 3 The hierarchy of these rules is simple: UCL rules in the Academic Manual override all rules and regulations set by faculties and departments. Faculty rules override rules set by departments. 2.3 Key staff members within the department and faculty Head of Department Dr Jean-Baptiste Gouyon j.gouyon@ucl.ac.uk Department Manager Giuseppe La Rosa sts-dm@ucl.ac.uk Director of Education & Student Experience Francesca Scott francesca.scott@ucl.ac.uk Faculty Student Experience Officer Sophia MacBlain s.macblain@ucl.ac.uk 4 3 Departmental staff related to the programme 3.1 Explanation to students of the roles of module and programme leaders and other key staff involved in programme delivery Role Person Email Director of Education UG Careers Officer Professor Joe Cain j.cain@ucl.ac.uk Undergraduate Programme Tutor Dr Charlotte Sleigh c.sleigh@ucl.ac.uk MSc History and Philosophy of Science & MSc Science, Technology and Society Programme Tutor Dr Rory Jubber rory.jubber@ucl.ac.uk MSc Science Communication Programme Tutor Professor Melanie Smallman m.smallman@ucl.ac.uk iBSc Programmes Tutor Dr Erman S\u00f6z\u00fcdo\u011fru erman.sozudogru@ucl.ac.uk Affiliate Student Tutor Dr Michel Wahome m.wahome@ucl.ac.uk Student Success Adviser Tekla Palladino t.palladino@ucl.ac.uk Teaching Administrator Randalle Roberts sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk 5 4 Key dates 4.1 Term dates, exam/assessment period, core activities 4.1.1 UCL Term Dates: 2024/25 Term Dates First Term Monday 23 September 2024 to Friday 13 December 2024 Second Term Monday 13 January 2025 to Friday 28 March 2025 Third Term Monday 28 April 2025 to Friday 13 June 2025 For those departments that operate them, Reading Weeks are the weeks beginning Monday 4 November 2024 and Monday 17 February 2025.
