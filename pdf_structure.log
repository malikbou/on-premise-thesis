11 NarrativeText A warm welcome to those of you who are new and congratulations on making UCL your university of choice. To those of you returning, welcome back.
12 Header Your UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future.
12 NarrativeText We want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL’s research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges.
12 NarrativeText I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better.  Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience.
12 NarrativeText This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL’s history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL’s bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary.
12 NarrativeText UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible.
12 Title Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost
12 Title 1.2 Head of Department's welcome
12 Title Welcome to UCL’s Department of Computer Science.
12 NarrativeText Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.
12 Footer It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.
13 NarrativeText One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.
13 NarrativeText So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.
13 NarrativeText I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.
13 Title Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department

13 Footer You have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.
14 Header A key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.
14 NarrativeText You can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.

14 Title 1.4 About the Student Handbook
14 NarrativeText The Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life – sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.
14 NarrativeText Where information is available via UCL Students webpages or in the Academic Manual, which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.
14 NarrativeText You should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the Academic Manual. If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.

17 Title 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history
17 NarrativeText Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.
17 Footer In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data
18 Header communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department’s growth and reflects the leading- edge of contemporary computer science.
18 NarrativeText In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.
18 NarrativeText Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world’s challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.
18 Title 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department
18 NarrativeText The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department’s taught degree programmes.
18 NarrativeText UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL’s global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.
18 NarrativeText Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today’s societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.
18 NarrativeText Though diverse, all the Faculty’s departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.

59 NarrativeText UCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith and cultural background and the first to admit women. UCL expects its members to refrain from interfering with the proper functioning or activities of UCL, or of those who work or study at UCL. Students should ensure they read and familiarise themselves with UCL’s Student Code of Conduct and other related policies and should be aware that any inappropriate behaviour may lead to actions under UCL’s Student Disciplinary Procedures.

63 Title 7.1 About the UCL Student Support Framework
63 NarrativeText UCL is committed to providing the support students need in order to make the most out of their studies. The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help students understand the options open to them.
63 Title UCL’s Student Support Framework
63 NarrativeText The Framework includes the following components:
64 Header 7.1.1 Part 1: How to Use this Framework
64 NarrativeText Helps students find their way around the different support options open to them. It includes:
64 NarrativeText Where to find help and advice Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student) Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data Information on providing supporting evidence Links to other support options that are available to students.

64 Title What this covers
64 Title Delayed Assessment Scheme
64 NarrativeText You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC’s.
64 NarrativeText Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit.
64 Title Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances
64 Title Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions
64 Footer Academic Adjustments
64 NarrativeText You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence.
64 NarrativeText You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition.
64 Footer You need long-term or ongoing support with one or more of the following:
64 NarrativeText Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. ‘Extenuating Circumstances’ (often know as ‘ECs’) are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access ‘mitigation’ such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. UCL can provide longer-term ‘Reasonable Adjustments’ to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a ‘SoRA’ (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL’s Student Support and Wellbeing team. Academic Adjustments include long-term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need

65 NarrativeText You need additional support to sit an online or face-to- face exam.
65 NarrativeText You are thinking of taking time out from your studies .
65 NarrativeText You are having persistent or ongoing difficulties and UCL’s other support processes are not providing the right level of help.
65 NarrativeText Exam Adjustments are specifically for Controlled Condition Exams and Take-Home Papers, and include adjustments such as extra time, rest breaks, a more comfortable chair and specialist equipment. These are available to students with a longer-term disability or health condition, and to students who need shorter-term support e.g. if you are pregnant, or have a broken arm. Interruption of Study is for students who wish to take a break from their studies and return at a later date. You can take time out from your studies for a wide range of reasons - you might want to take up an internship or placement, take time out to travel, be planning to have children, or be facing personal challenges which are making it hard to study. Support to Study aims to help you if you are having significant, persistent, longer-term difficulties and UCL’s normal mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable Adjustments, Extenuating Circumstances, Interruption of Study) are not providing enough support. We will work with you to put together a Support Plan to help you get the most out of your studies.

81 Footer Support via Personal Tutoring
82 Header As part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.
82 NarrativeText At the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can’t attend a meeting. It’s important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.
82 NarrativeText Students should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.
82 NarrativeText Tutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.

86 NarrativeText Advice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.
86 Title 10.1 Modules
86 NarrativeText Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)
87 Header Compulsory modules are essential to a programme’s core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme’s core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.
87 NarrativeText Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.

87 Title Modules for Computer Science students
87 NarrativeText The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.
87 Title Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)
87 NarrativeText Ancillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.
87 Title Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)
87 NarrativeText Affiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.

88 Title 10.3 Module selection
88 Title 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25
88 NarrativeText Students needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment.
88 NarrativeText Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.

88 Title Approval of selections
88 Footer Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked
89 Header to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.
89 Title Change of selections
89 NarrativeText Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.
89 NarrativeText Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the ‘Module Selection Task’ on Portico.
89 Title Verification of selections
89 NarrativeText Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)
89 NarrativeText 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)
89 NarrativeText Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year’s duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.

90 Header 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places
90 NarrativeText Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department’s teaching capacity and other resource constraints.
90 NarrativeText Students are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:
90 NarrativeText Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) Students for whom the module is optional. Students for whom the module is elective.
90 NarrativeText Within those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.
90 NarrativeText All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.
90 Title 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module
90 NarrativeText Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.
90 NarrativeText Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.

91 Title 10.4 Module information
91 NarrativeText Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.
91 NarrativeText A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.
91 Title Module catalogue
91 NarrativeText Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection.
91 NarrativeText The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.

92 Title Module deliveries
92 NarrativeText A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.
92 NarrativeText Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.
92 Title Module timetable
92 NarrativeText Students can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.
92 NarrativeText Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.
92 NarrativeText Students selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.

93 Title 10.5 Key contacts for module selection
93 NarrativeText Contacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.
93 Title Academic advice on module selection
93 NarrativeText For academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.
93 NarrativeText Students intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module’s home department.
93 Title Academic advice on specific modules
93 NarrativeText For advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.
93 Title Administrative advice and troubleshooting
93 NarrativeText If a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator:

99 Title 11.3 Interruption of studies
99 NarrativeText Students needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.
99 NarrativeText Students who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the ‘Apply for an Interruption of Study’ form in the ‘Change of Circumstances’ section of 'My Studies'.
99 NarrativeText Note: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the ‘short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances’ process. This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.

100 NarrativeText If a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.
100 NarrativeText If a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator:

111 Title 13.1 Assessment
111 Title 13.1.1 Overview of assessment
111 NarrativeText All taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.
111 NarrativeText A variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.
111 NarrativeText Assessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.
111 NarrativeText A student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.
111 Title 13.1.2 Assessment structure
111 NarrativeText Each module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.

112 NarrativeText Each module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the UCL Module Catalogue. In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.
112 NarrativeText Students who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period

112 Title 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines
112 NarrativeText Information on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.
113 NarrativeText Each summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.
113 Title Deliverables
113 NarrativeText An assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.
113 NarrativeText Where a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)
113 Title Individual and group work
113 NarrativeText An assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)
113 NarrativeText Often, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.
113 NarrativeText The task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.
113 Title Engagement in group assessment activity
114 NarrativeText All members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.
114 NarrativeText Where upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.
114 NarrativeText Learning outcomes
114 NarrativeText Each programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.
114 NarrativeText A module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL Module Catalogue.
114 NarrativeText Marking criteria
114 NarrativeText Each task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.
114 NarrativeText Summative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the ‘absolute’ quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.
114 Footer Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.

115 Title 13.1.4 Marking scales
115 NarrativeText Computer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.
115 NarrativeText Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.
115 NarrativeText Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.

115 Title 13.2 Feedback
116 Header 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks
116 NarrativeText Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.
116 Title UCL feedback policy
116 NarrativeText It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.
116 NarrativeText If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.
116 Title Computer Science feedback policy
116 NarrativeText For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.
116 NarrativeText For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.
116 NarrativeText The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.
116 Title Computer Science exam script policy
116 NarrativeText UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.
116 Footer Computer Science provisional marks policy
117 NarrativeText UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

118 Header Examination scheduling
118 NarrativeText Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.
118 NarrativeText The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:
118 UncategorizedText Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025

120 Title 13.4 Coursework
120 NarrativeText Information on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.
120 NarrativeText Coursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.
120 NarrativeText Most modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.
120 Title Coursework scheduling
120 NarrativeText Coursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:
120 NarrativeText Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)
120 NarrativeText Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.
120 Footer Coursework submission
121 Header Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.
121 NarrativeText Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.
121 Title Support for coursework submission
121 NarrativeText Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.
121 NarrativeText Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.

121 Title 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations
121 NarrativeText Coursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.
121 Footer Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied
122 Header to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)
122 NarrativeText However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.
122 NarrativeText The Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.
122 NarrativeText Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure
122 NarrativeText If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.
122 Title Further information:

122 Title Late penalties & latest permissible submission
122 NarrativeText Work is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.
122 Footer For assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:
123 Header Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)
123 Header Description of penalty to apply

123 Title Component mark of 1.00%.
123 NarrativeText Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided.
123 UncategorizedText Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners.
123 Title Component mark of zero.
123 NarrativeText Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.
123 NarrativeText Work submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.
123 Title Application of late penalties
123 NarrativeText Late penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.

124 NarrativeText 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits
124 Title Information about word count limits and penalties.
124 NarrativeText Assessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.
124 NarrativeText For project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.
124 Title Application of word count penalties
124 NarrativeText Word count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied.

125 NarrativeText Information about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.
125 NarrativeText Examinations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.
125 NarrativeText If a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.
125 NarrativeText Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure
125 NarrativeText If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.

125 Title 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)
126 Header Information on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.
126 NarrativeText Students are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:
126 ListItem 1. be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);
126 ListItem 2. be required to resit failed components of the module; 3. be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or 4. apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.
126 Title Condonement
126 NarrativeText Condonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.
126 NarrativeText Students who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.
126 NarrativeText A student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.

127 Title Reassessment (resits, repeats)
127 NarrativeText Where a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.
127 NarrativeText Depending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:
127 NarrativeText Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period. Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components. Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.
127 NarrativeText Arrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.
127 NarrativeText The marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)

128 NarrativeText If an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.
128 NarrativeText If a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.

128 Title Information about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.
128 Title Academic standards and integrity
128 Footer High academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References,
129 Header Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.
129 NarrativeText In particular, students should familiarise themselves with:
129 NarrativeText the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage. the UCL Moodle course 'Introduction to Academic Integrity'. referencing and citation requirements, as set out in UCL Library Services' guidance on References, citations and avoiding plagiarism. examination conduct requirements, as set out in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates, which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website. Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.
129 NarrativeText In addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:
129 NarrativeText referencing conventions; opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others; attribution of contributions in group work; and any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.
129 NarrativeText The vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.
129 NarrativeText For students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, Turnitin can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)
129 Title Academic integrity in Computer Science modules
129 Footer For Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:
130 NarrativeText Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the "giver" and "receiver" of material as equally culpable.
130 NarrativeText Students should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.
130 NarrativeText Finally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.
130 NarrativeText Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating
130 NarrativeText Students work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.
130 NarrativeText UCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.
130 NarrativeText Students should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.
130 NarrativeText Investigating and penalising academic misconduct
130 NarrativeText Examiners will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.
130 Footer In addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or
131 Header submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.
131 NarrativeText Where academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.

131 NarrativeText Information about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)
131 NarrativeText Research ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.
131 NarrativeText All Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through
132 Header the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.

132 Title Information about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.
132 NarrativeText All work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second- marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.
132 NarrativeText Computer Science marking policies
132 NarrativeText For Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.
132 NarrativeText If a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.
133 Title 13.12 External examining
133 Title Information about external examining at UCL.
133 NarrativeText External Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.
133 NarrativeText Each external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.
133 NarrativeText Students can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at cs.assessment- team@ucl.ac.uk. On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services (examiners@ucl.ac.uk.)

165 Title 16.3 Optional internships and placements
165 NarrativeText Information on optional internships that are not part of the programme
165 NarrativeText An internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.
165 NarrativeText Undergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.
165 Title Departmental research internships
165 NarrativeText The department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.
165 Title Industrial placement year ('year in industry')
166 Header Students who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.
166 Title Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations
166 NarrativeText Student projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's Industry Exchange Network (IXN.) Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.

172 Title 17.3 Academic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)
172 NarrativeText Students’ Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL. One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.
172 NarrativeText Every student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice. They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve. They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students’ Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.
172 Title Course Representatives
172 NarrativeText Students from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them. The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.
172 Footer Lead Departmental Representatives
173 Header Once Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes. The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.
173 Title Faculty Representatives
173 NarrativeText Faculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.
173 Title Elections
173 NarrativeText Academic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students’ Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better. Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.

174 NarrativeText Other ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.
174 Title 17.5.1 Staff office hours
174 NarrativeText Each Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.
175 Header Office hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.
175 Title Further information:
175 Title Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook
175 Title 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires
175 NarrativeText Students will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term. These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given in Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook.
175 Title 17.5.3 Student forum
175 NarrativeText The department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff. Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution. Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum. If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.

182 NarrativeText The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.
182 Footer Our goal is to put students’ feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students’ feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space – including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we’ve focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.
183 Header The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:
183 NarrativeText The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook.) The student membership on UCL's committees. The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities. The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities. The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per- programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department. The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.
183 NarrativeText Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.

Whether it’s about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.
184 NarrativeText Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL – including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.

184 NarrativeText Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.
184 NarrativeText Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.
184 NarrativeText These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff ‘check-in’ with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful

198 NarrativeText Students are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL’s file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the Technical Support Group, for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.
198 NarrativeText If students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The UCL Dropbox service may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.
198 NarrativeText If students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.

217 NarrativeText Information on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.
217 NarrativeText A graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.
217 NarrativeText Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)
217 NarrativeText In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:

223 NarrativeText Students will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.
223 NarrativeText Students should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.
223 Footer Mailing lists
224 Header Students will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.
224 Title Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels
224 NarrativeText Connected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.
224 Title Access and technical support
224 NarrativeText Access to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.
224 Title 24.2.2 Social media
224 NarrativeText Computer Science is active on the following social media channels:
224 NarrativeText Computer Science X – the department's official X channel. Computer Science YouTube –the department's YouTube channel. Computer Science LinkedIn – the department's LinkedIn page.

247 Title Introduction
247 Title Academic Requirements
247 Title Application Process
247 Title Stage 1: Initial Enquiry and Proposal
247 Title Stage 2: Application
247 Title Stage 3: Placement
247 Title Introduction
247 NarrativeText An Additional Year in Industry (also referred to here as "Additional Placement Year", "Placement Year", and "Year in Industry Placement") is an additional credit-bearing year of study in which a student undertakes an approved Placement as part of an eligible BSc or MEng programme. The Placement must be spent attached to an organisation or institution approved by the department on behalf of UCL as having a function relevant and suitable to the student's programme of study.
247 Title Application and eligibility
247 NarrativeText In order to be approved to undertake an Additional Year in Industry, a student must satisfy/complete all of the below. See Application Process for detailed guidance.
247 NarrativeText Arrange their own Placement opportunity (i.e. secure an internship/ employment contract with an appropriate industry host) prior to submitting a Placement Proposal. Satisfy the Initial Academic Requirements. Submit a Placement Proposal by the deadline and have this approved.
248 Header Submit a Placement Application by the deadline and have this approved. Submit a request to transfer to the Year in Industry programme and have this approved. Satisfy the Final Academic Requirements.
248 NarrativeText If a student is not approved to take an Additional Year in Industry (i.e. if their Placement Proposal or Application is unsuccessful), they may opt to interrupt their studies and take the internship independently (i.e. not as part of their programme); students who interrupt their studies should be aware that this may have visa implications.
248 Title Restrictions on places
248 NarrativeText All Placement Proposals received within the application window (Monday 17 March 2025– Friday 28 March 2025) will be considered. A maximum of eight Placement Proposals will be approved to proceed to the next stage of the application process; these will be approved on a first-come first serve basis according to the date/ time the successful Placement Proposal was submitted. A reserve list will be operated in the same order (i.e. in the event that a Placement Proposal that was originally progressed is cancelled for any reason.)
248 Title Programme structure
248 NarrativeText A Placement is usually taken between the penultimate and final year of the programme, which extends the duration of the programme by one academic year, as follows:
248 Title BSc - No Placement
248 Title BSc - Placement between Years 2 and 3
248 Title MEng - No Placement
248 Title MEng - Placement between Years 2 and 3
248 Title MEng - Placement between Years 3 and 4

248 Title Year 4 (MEng)
248 NarrativeText The Placement is represented on the programme by a Placement Module, Computer Science Internship (COMP0033). The Placement Module is worth 30 credits at FHEQ Level 6, is Non-Condonable, and is weighted at 0 for the purpose of Classification.
249 Header Curriculum and assessment
249 NarrativeText The Placement Module is assessed by a summative Placement Project (weighted at 100%), which requires students to submit a written report at the end of their placement. The written report will be submitted to the host company for approval and then to the department for marking. If a student fails the Placement Module at the First Attempt then they will be offered a Second Attempt. The Second Attempt will be a further opportunity to submit the written report. If a student fails the Placement Module at the Second Attempt then they will be transferred to their originating programme (without Year in Industry.)
249 Title Conduct and engagement
249 NarrativeText Students on a Placement will be subject to engagement monitoring by the department. Students will be required to remain in regular contact with departmental staff throughout the duration of the placement and be responsive to communications received from staff. This is so that the department remains able to fulfil its duty of care to the student.
249 Title Placement opportunities
249 NarrativeText Placement Year opportunities will be advertised if and when they become available; the majority of placements will be sought by the student themselves. There is no guarantee that places will be available or will be with a specific company or in a specific area. Any placement must be approved by the department and by the Faculty Education Committee, which will make sure that adequate, identifiable supervision and training are provided by the host company, that adequate supervision is provided by the student’s home department, and that the student’s plan of work for the year is related to the student’s core discipline and is of adequate level.
249 Title Academic Requirements
249 NarrativeText In order to be eligible to apply for and commence a placement, a student must have achieved and maintained an acceptable standard of academic performance through their programme. An applicant's performance will be evaluated at the following intervals:
249 ListItem 1. Initial Academic Requirements: at the point of their initial application;
249 ListItem 2. Final Academic Requirements: at the end of the year of study prior to the placement (i.e. at the point that their progression is determined.)
250 Header The department reserves the right to rescind an application at any stage where a student's academic performance falls below the level expected. In that case, the student will continue on or transfer back to their originating programme of study (i.e. without Year in Industry.)
250 Title Academic Requirements to submit a Placement Proposal & Placement Application:
250 Title Initial Academic Requirements:
250 Title Between Years 2 and 3
