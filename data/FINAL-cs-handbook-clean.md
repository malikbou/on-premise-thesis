## 1.2 Head of Department's welcome
Welcome to UCL’s Department of Computer Science. Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world. It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country. One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you. So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being. I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year. Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department

# 2. Introduction to the department and faculty
An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.

## 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history
Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research. In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data [communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department’s growth and reflects the leading-](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study) [edge of contemporary computer science.  ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study) In the [2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed.](https://www.ref.ac.uk/) [61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.](https://www.ref.ac.uk/) Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world’s challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.

## 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department
The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that [opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/study/undergraduate/how-we-teach) [participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/study/undergraduate/how-we-teach) [broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/study/undergraduate/how-we-teach) groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department’s taught degree programmes. UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL’s global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work. Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today’s societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques. Though diverse, all the Faculty’s departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.

### 8.3.4 Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects
Information about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module. [Students will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/ucl-industry-exchange-network-ucl-ixn) [Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/ucl-industry-exchange-network-ucl-ixn). Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.

## 8.4 Professional accreditation and certification
Many UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legally- recognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.

## 8.5 Module details
Programmes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet [specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) methods is available via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).

# 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring
Information on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)

## 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring
UCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.

### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring
Support via Personal Tutoring As part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support. At the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can’t attend a meeting. It’s important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them. Students should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively. Tutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees. [Personal tutors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors)

## 9.2 Transition mentoring
Information on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students. The UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme. First-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events. [Transition Mentors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)

## 9.3 Programming tutoring
Information on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students. All Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme. The scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.

# 10. Module information & selection
Advice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.

## 10.1 Modules
Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.) Compulsory modules are essential to a programme’s core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme’s core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.

## 10.2 Module availability
Modules for Computer Science students [The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/PROG--Programmes.aspx) [level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/PROG--Programmes.aspx) [the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/PROG--Programmes.aspx) Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students) Ancillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director. Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange) Affiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions. [Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science/2020) [Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science/2020)

## 10.3 Module selection

### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25
[Students needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/new-students/your-journey-joining-ucl/pre-enrolment-stages-new-students) can register for modules once they have completed [pre-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/new-students/your-journey-joining-ucl/pre-enrolment-stages-new-students). Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed [re-enrolment. ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/status/enrolment/continuing-students) Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible. [Pre-enrolment for new students | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/new-students/your-journey-joining-ucl/pre-enrolment-stages-new-students) [Re-enrolment for continuing students | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/new-students/your-journey-joining-ucl/pre-enrolment-stages-new-students) [Module selection | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/status/enrolment/continuing-students) Approval of selections Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process. Change of selections Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader. Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the ‘Module Selection Task’ on Portico. Verification of selections Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)

### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)
Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year’s duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer. [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)

### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places
Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department’s teaching capacity and other resource constraints. Students are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) Students for whom the module is optional. Students for whom the module is elective. Within those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module. All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.

### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module
Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.

## 10.4 Module information
Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity. A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across [the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/LRN--Module-Information.aspx) modules have [published module introduction videos to help inform module selection.](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/LRN--Module-Information.aspx) The [UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period,](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year.

[UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/) [Module introductions | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/) Module deliveries [A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [programme of study.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme. Module timetable Students can view module timetables via the [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/tt/homePage.do), which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, [groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/tt/homePage.do) Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other. Students selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week. [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/tt/homePage.do)

## 10.5 Key contacts for module selection
Contacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise. Academic advice on module selection For academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor. Students intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module’s home department. Academic advice on specific modules [For advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue. ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) Administrative advice and troubleshooting If a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator:

# 11. Changes to registration status
Information on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.

## 11.1 Changing registration status
Students wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options [available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the UCL Academic](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) [Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record. Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change. [Chapter 3: Registration Framework for Taught Programmes | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) [Change your programme or modules | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/status/change-your-studies/change-your-degree-programme-or-modules)

## 11.2 Changing programme
Students wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections. [Students must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-04-Key-dates.aspx) [in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in Section 4:](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-04-Key-dates.aspx) [Key dates | CS Student Handbook.](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-04-Key-dates.aspx) Study Abroad and Placement Years Students who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by [the deadline given in Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-04-Key-dates.aspx).

## 11.3 Interruption of studies
Students needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice. Students who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the ‘Apply for an Interruption of Study’ form in the ‘Change of Circumstances’ section of 'My Studies'. Note: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the ‘short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances’ process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt. [Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/SW--Interruption.aspx) [Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/SW--Interruption.aspx) [Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)

## 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme
Students wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available. Students who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the ‘Withdraw from your programme’ form in the ‘Change of Circumstances’ section of 'My Studies'. Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change. [Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/withdrawing-your-studies) [Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/withdrawing-your-studies)

## 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status
If a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption. If a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator:

## 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status
If a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the [first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk and](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)[) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) [academic merits of a decision to change status.](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)

# 13. Assessment and feedback
Information on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.

## 13.1 Assessment

### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment
All taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes. A variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation. Assessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module. A student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module. [SKIPPING TABLE SECTION: 13.1.2] Coursework Coursework 1 Coursework Coursework 2 Open book examination Online remote examination Each module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue. In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) [differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section. Students who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment) [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)

### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines
Information on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them. Each summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks. Deliverables An assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables. Where a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.) Individual and group work An assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.) Often, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task. The task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment. Engagement in group assessment activity All members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately. Where upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published. Learning outcomes Each programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes. [A module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL Module Catalogue.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/) Marking criteria Each task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out. Summative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the ‘absolute’ quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort. Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum. [Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information#2.2) [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information#2.2) [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)

### 13.1.4 Marking scales
Computer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment. Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark. Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module. [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)

## 13.2 Feedback

### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks
Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation. UCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

## 13.3 Examinations
Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice. Please check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information: [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) Examination scheduling Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms. The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows: Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025 The timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable. [Chapter 4, Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-8-assessment-feedback#8.2) Examination conduct Students must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/exams/examination-guide-candidates) [Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/exams/examination-guide-candidates) questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.

Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.

## 13.4 Coursework
Information on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available. Coursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions. Most modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised. Coursework scheduling Coursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows: Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.) Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section. Coursework submission Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere. Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline. Support for coursework submission [Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in [person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience. [Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the](https://tsg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) [examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to](https://tsg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) technical support, where that applies.

## 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations
[SKIPPING TABLE SECTION: 13.5]
Application of late penalties Late penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners. [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment) [Chapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment) [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12)

## 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits
Information about word count limits and penalties. Assessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters. For project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them. Application of word count penalties Word count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email. [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)

## 13.7 Absence from assessments
Information about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this. Examinations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time. If a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt. Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion. [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment) [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)

## 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)
Information on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts. Students are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:
1. be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their
programme);
2. be required to resit failed components of the module;
[3. be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating)
[4. apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating)
Condonement Condonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met. Students who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed. A student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations. [Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-award) [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-award) [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-award#6.3) [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/exams/late-summer-assessment-january-re-sits/guide-undergraduate-condonement) Reassessment (resits, repeats) Where a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules. Depending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat: Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period. Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components. Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees. Arrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners. The marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.) [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure) [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure) [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4) Deferred assessment If an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.

## 13.9 Academic integrity
Information about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures. Academic standards and integrity High academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary. In particular, students should familiarise themselves with: [the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/academic-integrity#resources). the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity'.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/academic-integrity#resources) [referencing and citation requirements, as set out in UCL Library Services' guidance on References, citations and avoiding plagiarism](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/enrol/index.php?id=39060). [examination conduct requirements, as set out in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates, which is published annually on the](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/libraryskills-ucl/guides-and-elearning/references-citations-and-avoiding-plagiarism) [Examinations and Awards website.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/sites/students/files/ucl-examinations-candidate-guide.pdf) [Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/sites/students/files/ucl-examinations-candidate-guide.pdf) In addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example: referencing conventions; opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others; attribution of contributions in group work; and any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission. The vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, [there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.3) in exclusion from UCL, as per the [Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure#9.3). For students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in [Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure) [define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure) be considered as academic misconduct (for example, Turnitin can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.) Academic integrity in Computer Science modules For Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the "giver" and "receiver" of material as equally culpable. Students should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work. Finally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting. Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating Students work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements. UCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities. Students should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree. Investigating and penalising academic misconduct Examiners will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted. [In addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/ELearningStudentSupport/Turnitin+assignment+for+submission+and+feedback#Turnitinassignmentforsubmissionandfeedback-WhatisTurnitin?) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)[ for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/ELearningStudentSupport/Turnitin+assignment+for+submission+and+feedback#Turnitinassignmentforsubmissionandfeedback-WhatisTurnitin?) submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct. Where academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.

## 13.10 Research ethics
Information about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.) Research ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase. All Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader. [UCL Research Ethics | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-ethics)

## 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation
Information about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks. All work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second- marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives. Computer Science marking policies For Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking. If a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.

## 13.12 External examining
Information about external examining at UCL. External Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities. Each external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees. [Students can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies',](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk) 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk) [team@ucl.ac.uk.

## 14.3 Moodle (virtual learning environment)
Information on how to access Moodle and support contacts. Moodle is UCL's online learning space. It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments. All taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions. Assessment information on Moodle Each module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team ([cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk)](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk) Access to Moodle pages Students will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.

## 15.4 UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours
Information about UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours .

### 15.4.1 Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse
Every student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly. To help with this, UCL has Report and Support, an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options. Examples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to: Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment. Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal. Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access. If a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis. Students can request to speak to all the following advisors: Dignity Advisor Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff) Student Casework Team Independent Sexual Violence Advisors Student Support and Wellbeing The department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.

## 16.3 Optional internships and placements
Information on optional internships that are not part of the programme An internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation. Undergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme. Departmental research internships The department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams. Industrial placement year ('year in industry') Students who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree. Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations Student projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's Industry Exchange Network (IXN.) Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.

## 17.3 Academic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)
Students’ Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL. One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme. Every student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice. They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve. They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students’ Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL. Course Representatives Students from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them. The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency. Lead Departmental Representatives Once Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes. The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives. Faculty  Representatives Faculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion. Elections Academic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students’ Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better. Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.

## 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee
Information on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee. Every department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year. Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students’ concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement. SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative. Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study. Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.

## 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back
Other ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.

### 17.5.1 Staff office hours
Each Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system. Office hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available. [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/SW--Support-Sessions.aspx#teaching-and-learning-team-drop-in-sessions)

### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires
Students will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term. These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the [teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-18-Student-feedback-and-You-Shape-UCL.aspx) [in Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook.](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-18-Student-feedback-and-You-Shape-UCL.aspx)

# 18. Student feedback

## 18.1 The role of student feedback
The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results. Our goal is to put students’ feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students’ feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space – including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we’ve focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: The [student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-17-Student-representation-and-voice.aspx) (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-17-Student-representation-and-voice.aspx).) The [student membership on UCL's committees.](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-17-Student-representation-and-voice.aspx) The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities. The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities. The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per- programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department. The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers. Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor. [You Shape UCL | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/) [Survey News and Results | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/)

## 18.2 Student surveys
Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey. One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it’s about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL – including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.

## 18.3 Module dialogue
Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important. Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff ‘check-in’ with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.

## 18.4 UCL Changemakers
Information on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved. UCL ChangeMakers helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL: Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students’ experience at UCL.

Students may send queries on data protection matters to the University Data Protection Officer ([data-protection@ucl.ac.uk.)](mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk) [General Student Privacy Notice | UCL Legal Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/student-privacy-notice) [Information Security Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/student-privacy-notice) [Email Usage Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security) [Data Protection Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/sites/information-security/files/email.pdf) [Understand your intellectual property (IP) rights | UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-protection/) [Report a Breach of Personal Data | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/students/understand-your-intellectual-property-ip-rights#:~:text=Generally%2c%20as%20a%20student%2c%20you%2cfunded%20by%20an%20external%20organisation.)

## 21.2 Storing and securing data
Students are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL’s file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the Technical Support Group, for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size. If students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The UCL Dropbox service may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services. If students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.

## 22.1 Health, Safety and Security at UCL
UCL’s overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an integral part of the way in which UCL’s activities are managed and conducted. There are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to provide the safe and healthy environment: UCL Security, who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours; UCL Safety Services, who manage the safety management system including providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive samples; UCL Estates who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators. [Accidents and Emergencies | UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/safety-ucl/accidents-and-emergencies) [Emergency contacts | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/safety-ucl/accidents-and-emergencies) [Staying safe | UCL Students - UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/staying-safe/emergency-contacts) [Safety Services | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/new-students/countdown-ucl/staying-safe) [Fire Safety at UCL | UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/) [Security at UCL | UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/fire) [Safety on and off campus | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl) [SafeZone App | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/personal-safety/safety-and-campus)

## 22.2 Health and safety at Computer Science
The policy of the department is to promote the safety, health and welfare of all its staff, students, visitors, contractors and members of the public on the department's premises and to protect them elsewhere from any adverse effect on their health or safety arising from the activities of the Department. The Head of Department is responsible for safety in connection with work done in the Department and in its name. The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working. The department's health and safety webpage describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations. [Computer Science Safety](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/HS--Health-and-Safety.aspx)

## 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department
Students should report any safety issues or concerns to the [Departmental Safety Officer](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-02-Introduction-to-the-Department-and-Faculty.aspx#other-departmental-contacts) as soon as possible. In particular, students should [report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/CS-StudentHandbook/SitePages/Section-02-Introduction-to-the-Department-and-Faculty.aspx#other-departmental-contacts) urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.

# 23. After study
Information on confirmation of student status, transcripts and certificates, Higher Education Achievement Reports, academic references, and on UCL Alumni activities.
[SKIPPING TABLE SECTION: 23.1]

## 23.2 Restrictions and delays affecting the release and certification of results
Any module results and programme outcomes are provisional until confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners, and any recommended award is provisional until conferred by UCL Education Committee. Typically, the Board of Examiners meets once in the summer to confirm marks for modules taken in terms 1, 2, and 3 (including undergraduate projects/ dissertations), once in the late summer to confirm the results of late summer assessments, and once in the autumn to confirm marks for taught postgraduate projects/ dissertations. Where a student's full set of module results is not available at a meeting of the programme Board of Examiners, for example because of an ongoing extension, deferral, or unresolved investigation under the academic misconduct regulations, then confirmation of results and conferral of any award may be delayed, subject to the availability of the Board of Examiners to review the delayed results. The department will endeavour to minimise any such delays and to make any recommendations for award as expeditiously as possible.

## 23.3 Confirmation of student status (statement of student status)
A [statement of student status](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/status/your-student-status/statement#What%20is%20SOSS) is an official letter that can used as proof of enrolment at UCL. The statement confirms a student's current [enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/status/your-student-status/statement#What%20is%20SOSS) The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.

## 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)
Information on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.

### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results
A transcript is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards. Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher) Students may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript. Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award) Students will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date. Affiliate students Students will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students’ home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students’ registered contact addresses. UCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the UCL Transcript Service. [Transcripts | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/certificates-results/transcripts) [Transcripts service | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/certificates-results/transcripts)

### 23.4.2 Degree certificates
A degree certificate is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL. Graduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date. [Degree Certificates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/certificates-results/degree-certificates) [Chatper 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/certificates-results/degree-certificates)

### 23.4.3 Statements of award
A statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred. [Students can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via askUCL (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.) ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl-student-enquiry-system)

## 23.5 Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)
Information about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.) A Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) is an electronic transcript of a student’s verified academic results and approved non- academic achievements whilst at UCL. New students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, Gradintel. Each summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account. [Higher Education Achievement Report | HEAR](http://www.hear.ac.uk/about) [Higher Education Achievement Reports (HEAR) | UCL Students](http://www.hear.ac.uk/about)

## 23.6 Academic references
Information on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study. An academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references. Where a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines. Students should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year. [Chapter 14: Student Reference Policy | UCL Academic Manual ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-teaching-and-learning)

## 23.7 Graduation ceremonies
Information on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies. A graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification. Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.) In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date. Once invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a [Graduation ceremonies | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/)

## 23.8 UCL Alumni community
Information on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities. An alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution. As UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All UCL alumni can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL’s lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts. [Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) [Services for Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) [Alumni of the department | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/services)[ ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/alumni)

# 24. Keeping in touch
Details of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies. [SKIPPING TABLE SECTION: 24.1]

## 24.2 Computer Science communications

### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams
Students will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account. Students should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given. Mailing lists Students will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications. Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels Connected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered. Access and technical support [Access to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) [regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support)
