## 2.1 Introduction to the department and its history
UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an academic unit for  research and teaching made at a ‘crossroads’ of different disciplinary perspectives.    As a Department, we were first established in 1921 specialising in history and philosophy  of science, with social science approaches being added in more recent years. STS is  now unique in the UK in combining – in one Department – teaching and research in  history and philosophy of science with social studies of science including science policy,  public understanding of science and science communication.    During the 2021/22 Academic Session, we celebrated our Centenary and we have  [collated some of the highlights from our past in the History of STS page on our website. ](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/about-sts)
STS is part of UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MAPS), which is part  of UCL School of the Built Environment, Engineering and Mathematical and Physical  Sciences (BEAMS).

#################################################################

## 2.2 Explanation of the relationship between department and faculty
Your degree is defined by three layers of regulations. Students are expected to  [familiarise themselves with documents applying to their degrees. These are: ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/)
•[ Regulations set by UCL – general information is can be found on the Student and ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/)

These are available in the appendices and
[on the STS Moodle page.  ](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=30690)

The hierarchy of these rules is simple: UCL rules in the Academic Manual override all  rules and regulations set by faculties and departments. Faculty rules override rules set by  departments.

It is essential that you check your personal timetable to ensure that  you are entered for the correct examinations.
STS students who require special examination arrangements, (i.e., students with  conditions such as dyslexia, visual impairment, or other medical conditions) may request  reasonable adjustments to complete an exam. The process for students to apply for

these arrangements is usually communicated during term 2, although students can apply  for reasonable adjustments at any point after they have enrolled.

#################################################################

## 4.2 Department- and faculty-level events and key dates
Key dates for HPSC modules are posted in the module syllabus and, normally, on the  module’s Moodle page.     Key dates for the department are posted on the STS website and are advertised to  students via UCL email address and via STS social media.     STS run a comprehensive programme of seminars and events, which are widely  publicised on social media and through departmental channels. All STS students are  invited to attend.

#################################################################

## 4.3 How UCL and the department will communicate with students
UCL will communicate with students via:  §  UCL student email – Students should check their UCL email regularly.  • [UCL student email  ](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/email-calendar)    §  UCL Moodle – UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme  leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to  learning resources.  • [UCL Moodle ](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/)     §  myUCL – A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and  postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and  opportunities.  •[  myUCL ](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/student/what-is-myucl)     §  UCL Instagram – UCL’s official Instagram channel, featuring news, events,  competitions and images from across the UCL community.  •[  UCL Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/ucl/)
§  X.com/ucl - Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL’s diverse community.  • [X.com/ucl ](https://x.com/ucl)
The department will communicate with students via UCL student email and UCL Moodle.

#################################################################

## 5.1 Hours of study
In general, both undergraduates and postgraduate students are expected to study 150  hours in total for each 15-credit module. This time is made up of formal learning and  teaching events such as lectures, seminars and tutorials, as well as independent study.  Teaching events normally take place Monday to Friday between 09.00 and 17.00,  although students taking modules outside of STS may find that other departments teach  after 17.00.
Reading Weeks are not intended as periods of leave from the programme of study. They  are purposefully unstructured time in the academic diary, reserved for catching up,  reflecting, pursuing related projects, and making substantial progress on assessed  coursework. These are not intended to be holidays.

#################################################################

## 5.2 Personal study time
Studying a subject in a module involves much more than class time. Students are  expected to make good use of independent reading, independent research, and self- directed study. UCL manages a spectacular range of resources towards these ends.  Discuss the possibilities with your personal tutor and module tutors. Also, please explore  along your own interests.  Students also are expected to commit considerable time to  assessed coursework and preparation for examinations.

#################################################################

## 5.3 Attendance requirements
5.3.1 Attendance Requirements
UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their  timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all  events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a  module, including personal tutorials.
Further information:
• [Attendance at UCL ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/attendance-ucl)
5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities
In line with UCL’s obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK  Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies.  RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance  team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements,  but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise  or assist the student.

## 6.1 UCL Code of Conduct
UCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal  opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith  and cultural background and the first to admit women. UCL expects its members to  refrain from interfering with the proper functioning or activities of UCL, or of those who  work or study at UCL. Students should ensure they read and familiarise themselves with  UCL’s Student Code of Conduct and other related policies and should be aware that any  inappropriate behaviour may lead to actions under UCL’s Student Disciplinary  Procedures.

# 7 UCL’s Student Support Framework
UCL is committed to providing the support you need in order to make the most out of your studies.  The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one  banner to help you understand the options open to you.
• [UCL’s Student Support Framework ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)
The Framework includes the following components:
Part 1: How to Use this Framework helps you find your way around the different support  options open to you. It includes:
•  Where to find help and advice    •  Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study  abroad or placement student)  •  Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after your data  •  Information on providing supporting evidence  •  Links to other support options that are available to you.
Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works:
Support process:  Use this if:  What this covers:
[Delayed ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Assessment ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Scheme ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)
You need a small amount of  flexibility to help you manage  your wellbeing, student life, and  workload due to reasons which  are not grounds for evidenced  EC’s.
Taught students have a maximum of 3  Delayed Assessment Permits to use  during the year. Each permit grants you  a set mitigation such as a 5working day  extension or deferral. There are no  minimum grounds, but you should think  carefully before using your permit.
Make sure to review the restrictions of  the scheme, and note that not all  assessments are eligible.
[Short-term Illness ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [and other ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Extenuating ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Circumstances ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)
You have a short-term illness,  bereavement or other unexpected  emergency. Normally you must  provide evidence.

‘Extenuating Circumstances’ (often  know as ‘ECs’) are events which are  sudden, unexpected, significantly  disruptive and beyond your control and  which may affect your performance at  summative assessment, such as a  serious illness or the death of a close  relative. You can submit an Extenuating  Circumstances claim to access  ‘mitigation’ such as an extension or  deferring an assessment to a later date.
[Reasonable ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Adjustments for ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Disabilities and ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Long-term ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Conditions ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)
You have a disability or long-term  physical or mental health  condition.
UCL can provide longer-term  ‘Reasonable Adjustments’ to support  your learning and assessment. This  includes setting up a ‘SoRA’ (Summary  of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL’s  Student Support and Wellbeing team.

Support process:  Use this if:  What this covers:
[Academic ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) [Adjustments ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)
You need long-term or ongoing  support with one or more of the  following:
• You or your partner is
pregnant or planning  maternity, paternity or adoption  leave  • You are a parent or carer  • You observe religious beliefs
or cultural customs  • You are affected by any form
of harassment or  discrimination   • You are affected by traumatic
world events such as war or  terrorism   • You are a critical worker (e.g.
NHS staff).
Academic Adjustments include long- term reasonable adjustments arranged  by your Department if you need  additional support with learning,  teaching and assessment.
[Exam Adjustments ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework) You need additional support to sit  an online or face-to-face exam.
Exam Adjustments are specifically for  Controlled Condition Exams and Take- Home Papers, and include adjustments  such as extra time, rest breaks, a more  comfortable chair and specialist  equipment. These are available to  students with a longer-term disability or  health condition, and to students who  need shorter-term support e.g. if you are  pregnant, or have a broken arm.
[Interruption of Study ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)

You are thinking of taking time  out from your studies  .
Interruption of Study is for students who  wish to take a break from their studies  and return at a later date. You can take  time out from your studies for a wide  range of reasons - you might want to  take up an internship or placement, take  time out to travel, be planning to have  children, or be facing personal  challenges which are making it hard to  study.
[Support to Study ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework)

You are having persistent or  ongoing difficulties and UCL’s  other support processes are not  providing the right level of help.
Support to Study aims to help you if you  are having significant, persistent, longer- term difficulties and UCL’s normal  mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable  Adjustments, Extenuating  Circumstances, Interruption of Study)  are not providing enough support. We  will work with you to put together a  Support Plan to help you get the most  out of your studies.

The Student Support Framework is just one of the ways in which UCL helps you to get the most  out of your time with us:
The Student Support  Framework
Your Personal Tutor  Your Department
The Student Support  Framework explains how you  can apply for formal support  with your studies such as  extensions, reasonable  adjustments, or taking time out  from your studies.
One of your first priorities  should be to meet your  Personal Tutor. They will help  you to get the most out of your  studies, and provide support  and encouragement during  your time with us.
Help is also available from  members of staff in your UCL  department including academic  staff and departmental  administrators. You can find  their contact details on Moodle  or in your Student Handbook.
UCL Student Support and  Wellbeing
FAQs and Enquiries  Students’ Union UCL Advice  Service
UCL’s team of expert  wellbeing, disability and mental  health staff provide a safe,  confidential and non- judgemental space in which  you can discuss any issues  that may be affecting your  ability to study.
askUCL is our self-help centre  and student enquiry system. It  includes a wide range of  Frequently Asked Questions. If  you can’t find what you’re  looking for, you can log an  enquiry.
The Students’ Union UCL  provides a free, confidential  and independent advice  service with a trained and  experienced team.

#################################################################

## 8.1 The structure of the programme, duration, credits, qualification(s)
Students with questions about their degrees or UCL rules should consult their personal  tutor in the first instance. The UCL Academic Manual is the first point of contact for the  rules themselves.
STS local rules define the modules required for completion of a particular degree.  Information for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes are available on the  STS website. Students are committed to the local rules in place for the year they started  their programme. Later changes to the local rules do not apply. The local rules are  available in the appendices and on the programme Moodle site that is applicable to your  programme of study. Please ensure that you familiarise yourself with these when you  make your module choices.
If a compulsory module becomes unavailable during the normal course of study, STS  programme tutors will consider substitutions and are the official source for approving  these substitutions. The main criterion for substitution is that the result maintains a  coherent programme of study within the degree title.

#################################################################

## 8.2 Projects, placements and study abroad (
8.2.1 Information on study abroad options
Students may have the option of study abroad in Year 3 of the degree. Please note that  the opportunity to apply for or secure a place on a year abroad is not guaranteed.  This  will depend on whether UCL can put in place appropriate arrangements for study abroad  with a suitable partner institution. The list of partner institutions abroad that you may be  able to apply for will be made available in the Autumn Term of your second year of study  at UCL. If there is an opportunity to apply for a year abroad, the success of your  application will depend on the number of study abroad places available at the relevant  partner institution, your academic standing and the strength of your study abroad  application, which will set out your motivations for studying abroad and your reasons for  applying for your preferred universities abroad. If a year is spent abroad in your third  year, then you will return to UCL for an additional fourth year of your UCL programme. In  such event your three-year UCL programme would automatically become a four-year  programme.

• [Go Abroad ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/go-abroad) • STS Study Abroad Tutor: Dr Simon Lock – simon.lock@ucl.ac.uk
8.2.2 Information on summer internships
STS has a summer studentship programme, which supports students working with STS  academics on research projects directly related to their research programmes. These  opportunities are circulated in the Spring, and STS students will be encouraged to apply.
8.2.3 Information on internships from UCL Careers
UCL has web resources, a student toolkit and bookable appointments for students to  support them with applications for internships, and guidance in sourcing opportunities.

#################################################################

## 9.1 What students can expect in terms of academic and personal tutoring
Academic and Personal Tutoring
UCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal  support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research  community. As part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every  undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who  can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.     At the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor,  and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive  in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure you reply to emails from your personal  tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if you can’t attend a meeting. It’s  important to build a relationship with your tutor so that you feel comfortable approaching  them, should problems arise. Your personal tutor can also provide academic references  for you, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.
STS prides itself on our personal tutoring system. Personal tutors are members of  academic staff trained to provide tailored academic advice (related to degrees and  university). They know about resources available elsewhere in UCL for support. This  includes physical and mental health, careers, rights and advice, and financial assistance.  UCL also is well-supported with academic and welfare teams for students in need.
Make the most of this relationship by meeting with your personal tutor on a regular basis.  We will invite you to termly meetings but take the initiative and ask for more if that suits  your needs. Meet monthly, for instance. Keep the conversation moving. Help your  personal tutor get to know you, your academic work and your aspirations. Personal tutors  are most effective when kept in conversation.

## 9.2 Transition Mentors (first-year undergraduate students only)
9.2.1 Transition Mentors
The UCL Transition Programme supports new first-year students at UCL, helping them  to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a  Transition Mentor for their first term. Transition mentors are later-year students within  each department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them  settle in to UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific  to their degree programme. First-year students meet their Transition Mentor during the  first week of term at their department’s ‘Meet your Mentor’ session.
Further information:
• [UCL Transition Mentors ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)

#################################################################

## 10.1 Choosing modules
Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit.
10.1.1 Choosing Modules for 2024/25
New MSc students, iBSc students from other institutions and affiliate students choose  their modules at the beginning of the academic year. First year undergraduate students  do not need to make module selections as the first year of the programme consists of 8  compulsory modules. Returning students will have made their module selections in Term  2 of the preceding academic year.
The options for students are outlined in our module catalogue. The department suggests  that a total of four modules should be taken each term. Changes to your initial selection  are possible, but this must be done as soon as possible and by the relevant deadline.
STS students should discuss their module selections with their personal tutor. For new  students, this discussion should be had at the end of induction week when personal tutor  meetings will be scheduled.
Students wishing to register on modules not run in STS normally need to secure  permission from the department delivering the module. Students are advised to confirm  that the module(s) they wish to take are open to students from other departments and  that they satisfy any pre-requisites. Each module entry in the UCL module catalogue  should have information on this but you are advised to contact the department if this is  unclear.
10.1.2 Process for Choosing Modules for 2025/26 (continuing students)
Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more  than 1 year’s duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for  2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.
10.1.3 UCL Module Catalogue
UCL‘s Module Catalogue gives access to a comprehensive catalogue of all modules  across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format.
Further information:
• [Module Catalogue ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/?collection=drupal-module-catalogue&facetsort=alpha&num_ranks=20&daat=10000&sort=title)
10.1.4 Module Selection and Verification Deadlines
You will receive an email through the Student Records system, Portico, with details of  module registration deadlines. Later on, you will also be asked to check in Portico and  confirm that your module registrations are correct. It is important that you check that you  are registered for the correct modules so that you are entered for the right assessments.
Further information:
• [Module Registration  ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/module-registration)
10.1.5 Change of Module Selection

If a student wishes to change a module selection, requests need to be submitted and  approved by the department.    Exact deadlines will be published each year in the ‘Module Selection Task’ on Portico.  On Online Programmes, exact deadlines will be set, managed and communicated by the  Department.

## 11.1 Information on how to change, interrupt or withdraw from a programme
Changes to Registration
Students wishing to make changes to their registration status should first discuss their  plans with their Personal Tutor or Supervisor who can explain the options available and  help students to make the right decision. Students should also ensure that they read the  relevant sections of the UCL Academic Manual before making any requests to change  their academic record.    Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.
11.1.1 Changing programme
If a student wishes to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, they must  make a formal application. The usual deadline for change of degree programme during  the academic session is the end of October each year (for students registering in  September, with a later date for students registering in January) to be compatible with  module selection deadlines, although later transfers may be possible, where the transfer  does not affect module selections. Students should log in to their Portico account and  complete the online application. Students are strongly advised to discuss their plan with  the departments involved before requesting a change of programme on Portico.

• [Academic Manual Chapter 3, Section 5 Programme Transfers ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-programme-transfers)
11.1.2 Withdrawing from a programme
If a student wishes to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final  examinations they must apply for a formal withdrawal from their studies. Applications  must be made in advance of the effective date of change. Students should log in to their  Portico account and complete the online application.
Further information:

11.1.3 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to your student status
If a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course  of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified.  The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student  withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to  a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of  study or when a student has returned from an interruption.    To inform the SLC of a change in your student status, a Change of Circumstance (CoC)  form must be completed online by your Faculty. See the Key Contacts section for details

of who to contact in the Faculty if you require a CoC form to be submitted on your behalf  or if you have any related queries.

## are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress
UCL’s Progression and Award Requirements define how many credits and modules  students need to pass to progress from one year of study to the next and to be awarded  a UCL qualification.    STS Bachelors Degrees:  These programmes use the Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements in  the UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression and Award.     STS Masters Degrees:  These programmes use the Masters Progression and Award Requirements in the UCL  Academic Manual, Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression and Award.    The regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific  regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and  Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their regulations are available. To find  the Tool, students should click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in  Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.
Further information:
• [Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression and Award ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-award)
• [Portico Login ](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)

#################################################################

## 12.2 How will marks be combined to reach a classification?
Students who have successfully completed the Progression and Award Requirements  will be awarded a Classification. The UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 4, Section 7:  Classification defines the Classification Schemes for each qualification.
The regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific  regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and  Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their regulations are available. To find  the Tool, students should click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in  Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.    STS Bachelors Degrees:  These programmes use UCL Honours Degree Classification Scheme B in the UCL  Academic Manual, Chapter 4, Section 7: Classification.
STS Masters Degrees:  These programmes use the Numeric Grade Taught Postgraduate Classification Scheme  in the UCL Academic Manual, Chapter 4, Section 7: Classification.

#################################################################

## 13.1 How will students be assessed?
STS prefers a scheme of continuous assessment, with a mixture of formative and  summative feedback. Assessment methods vary by module. STS modules use a variety  of assessment, including essays, blog posts, presentations, group work and posters.  Module tutors will describe assessment for their module at the start of term and in their  module syllabus

#################################################################

## 13.2 What are the marking criteria and learning outcomes?
STS follows a clear marking procedure for assessed coursework to ensure the marks  awarded to students are fair and appropriate. All work is marked in the first instance by  module tutors or teaching assistants and reviewed by a second marker. These markers  assess the work in accordance with the marking criteria and use their academic  judgement to determine an agreed mark for the piece of work. STS assessment criteria  are found in Appendices 2 and 3. It is also worth checking each STS Moodle site for the  marking criteria for each module.
In addition to this process, a sample of the work is also sent to an examiner who works  outside UCL. Their role is to verify the marking process as fair and consistent with UCL  regulations. Marks communicated to students during the academic year remain  provisional until they have been formally ratified by the STS Board of Examiners, and by  other examination boards within UCL if modules are taken in other departments.

#################################################################

## 13.3 What marking scale is in use on the programme?
STS uses a numerical marking scheme. See Appendices for UGT and PGT marking  schemes.

#################################################################

## their work and what will it look like?
For written assessments, STS will provide feedback that takes the form of being online  via the Moodle submission page for the module. Other feedback might include group  discussion, peer review etc. Module tutors hold office hours where students can get  feedback on assessments and advice on essay planning.     If you have any concerns about marks for any module, please consult the module tutor in  the first instance, and your personal tutor in the second instance, who can route queries  as needed.

#################################################################

## 13.5 UCL Standard turnaround time for feedback
UCL Feedback Turnaround Policy
Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. It is UCL policy that all  students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the  submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of written feedback, individual  discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions  (although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination  scripts). Students writing dissertations or research projects should also expect to receive  feedback on a draft on at least one occasion.    If, for whatever reason, a department/division cannot ensure that the one calendar month  deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided - it is  expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not

provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of their  Departmental Tutor or Head of Department.
Further information:
• [Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 5: Assessment Feedback ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)

#################################################################

## Examinations and Awards website
Please check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information:
• [Students’ webpages ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/)
13.6.1 Assessment Regulations
Students must ensure that they are aware of the regulations governing assessments and  examinations on the Examinations and Assessment website.
Further information:
• [Examinations and Assessments ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)

#################################################################

## the technical support available
Unless otherwise specified, coursework is submitted through Moodle. In the event that  [there are issues with Moodle and it is not possible to submit, the student will be expected ](mailto:sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk) [to e-mail their coursework to the module tutor, copied to the Teaching Administrator (sts-](mailto:sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk) [aa@ucl.ac.uk), prior to the advertised deadline. A screen shot of the error message ](mailto:sts-aa@ucl.ac.uk) (including date/time) will be required as supporting evidence. Students are responsible  for ensuring that their work is submitted on time.
Students should be aware that some file types (e.g. Apple pages) cannot be viewed by  many staff. Students should therefore submit coursework as Microsoft Word or PDF files.  If an attachment cannot be opened by UCL’s standard package of software - for  example, Apple Pages - it may be deemed as not submitted. Please remember to keep a  copy of all material uploaded or e-mailed.
UCL policy requires STS to mark coursework anonymously wherever possible. To  facilitate this, please submit assessed coursework without your name on the item. Use  only your student number/candidate number. Students who have added other identifiers  will be deemed to have waived their anonymity in that instance.

#################################################################

## 13.8 Information about penalties for late submissions
13.8.1 Coursework Late Submission Penalties
Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and  professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to  submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will  be applied.
However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of  study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme.  The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility  for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by

providing you with tools to access mitigations when you need, you can develop healthy  and resilient approaches to your studies.     The Delayed Assessment Scheme provide students a maximum of 3 permits to use  during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles you to a pre- determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral.  Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessment are eligible.
If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is  sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit  an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form. If the request is accepted, the student may be  granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be  condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.

#################################################################

## 13.9 Information about absence from assessment
13.9.1 Absence from Assessment
Any student who is absent from an assessment without prior permission will receive a  mark of 0.00%/ Grade F unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later  date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate  supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of  0.00%/ Grade F will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.

#################################################################

## 13.10 Information about word counts and penalties
Word Counts
Assignment briefs will include clear instructions about word counts, the inclusion of  footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies etc. Students are  expected to adhere to the requirements for each assessment. Students exceeding these  parameters may receive a reduction in marks.
STS will specify word counts in their assessments where appropriate. If students submit  work in excess of the word count, markers are not obliged to mark beyond the maximum  word count and proportionate penalties may apply but will not exceed 10 percentage  points (or equivalent).
Further information:
• [Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)

#################################################################

## 13.11 Information about the consequences of failure

Students are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student  fails an assessment at the first attempt they might:  §  Be eligible for Condonement  §  Need to Resit or Repeat the assessment  §  Apply for a Deferral or other support under the Extenuating Circumstances  procedures
Condonement
Condonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be  awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their  overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant  Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met. Students who meet the  Condonement Criteria will not be reassessed.    A student’s eligibility for Condonement in any given module is determined by the  programme on which they are enrolled - some modules may be ‘Non-Condonable’ i.e.  students must pass them. Condonement applies to module marks falling within a certain  range, and students will need to meet defined criteria to be eligible for Condonement.
Further information:
•[ Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression and Award ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-award)

• [Taught Postgraduate Student Guide to Condonement ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-guide-postgraduate-condonement)
Reassessment
Depending on the amount of failure, Reassessment may take the form of either a Resit,  which usually takes place in the Late Summer, or a Repeat in the following academic  session. The marks for modules successfully completed at the second attempt will be  capped at the Pass Mark – 40.00% for modules at UG Level/ Levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00%  for PGT modules at Masters Level/ Level 7.     Taught Postgraduate students:  Students who fail a Masters dissertation/ research project will normally resit by 31  January (30 April for January-start programmes). Exceptionally, the Exam Board may  decide that the extent of failure is such that the student needs to repeat the dissertation  with tuition and fees.
Further information:
• [Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-11-consequences-failure)
Deferred Assessment
If an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs) students may  be offered a Deferral i.e. a ‘new first attempt’ or a ‘new second attempt’. Students may be  able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible. If the

student successfully completes a Deferral of their first attempt, their module marks will  not be capped. If the student successfully completes a Deferral of their second attempt  (i.e. they have ECs on a Resit or Repeat), their module marks will be capped at the Pass  Mark (i.e. the existing cap will not be removed).

#################################################################

## 13.12 Academic Integrity
High academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in  UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and  study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously, and expects students to  familiarise themselves with UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting  point is the UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism.  Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing  requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.    Candidates for controlled condition examinations should also familiarise themselves with  the requirements set out in the Academic Manual, Chapter 6, Section 9.2 (weblink  provided below). It is also very important that students are aware of what items they are  permitted to bring into the Examination Halls, so they can ensure they do not  unintentionally breach the examination rules.
UCL has a zero tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating, as  they go against every principle that UCL stands for. These types of service disadvantage  honest students and devalue standards in our universities.    The vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their Academic Integrity throughout  their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to your  Academic Integrity as an instance of Academic Misconduct. When Academic Misconduct  occurs there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that  repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL  (see Academic Manual, Chapter 6, Section 9.3, web-link provided below). For students  who are unsure of what may be considered as Academic Misconduct, the procedures in  Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken  forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours  may be considered as Academic Misconduct.

## in the discipline

For preferred referencing style, please consult your module tutor as it may vary  depending on which module or department you are studying in.

#################################################################

## 13.14 Information about academic integrity (plagiarism) in the discipline
Plagiarism is defined as the presentation of another person's thoughts or words or  artefacts or software as though they were a student's own. All UCL students are required  to read UCL guidance on plagiarism including what it is and tips on how to avoid  plagiarism www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/guidelines/plagiarism.
Plagiarism constitutes an examination offence under UCL regulations, and it important  that students understand what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it. UCL  regulations governing plagiarism apply to all student work, including examinations,  assessed coursework and non-assessed coursework.
Self-plagiarism is an examination offense, too. This occurs when a student attempts to  obtain credit for the same work twice, and it can apply to work submitted to multiple  modules, degrees, or institutions.
All assessed coursework is submitted to plagiarism detection software, which uses a  mixture of online and print sources for comparison. Other techniques may also be used.

#################################################################

## etc. on the programme
Students involved in research with humans need to complete the ethics proforma  available on the STS website.  Ethics approval must be received by the Director of  Research before research with participants can be undertaken. You will be able to  receive confirmation that you have been granted Ethics approval.

#################################################################

## 13.16 Information about Marking, Second-Marking and Moderation
All work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal  Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second- marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair.  Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of  assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible.  Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different  modules, pathways, options and electives.

#################################################################

## reports via Portico
External Examining at UCL
External Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who  help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular,  External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping  UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have  been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at  other UK universities.    Each External Examiner submits an on-line annual report. Faculties and departments are  required to reflect on any recommendations and address any issues raised in a formal  response. The report and response are discussed with Student Reps at the Student  Partnership Committee, and are scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level  committees. Students can access their External Examiner’s report and departmental  response via the “My Studies” page through their Portico account either through ‘Module  Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’ or by contacting their Departmental

Administrator in the first instance. On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can  also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years.

Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in  some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be  integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules  may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and  assessments.

## harmful behaviours
15.4.1 Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse
Every student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing  harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of  our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these  issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be  unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the  knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.
To help with this, UCL has Report and Support, an on-line reporting tool where students  can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor  in order to make an informed decision about their options.
Unacceptable behaviour includes:
• Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the
purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating  environment.   • Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or
effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical,  verbal, or non-verbal.  • Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations,
comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.     If you experience any of these behaviours, you can report it and/or access support. You  can request to be contacted by an advisor or you can report anonymously. With either

option you can give as much or as little detail as you wish. The reports are strictly  confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.    Students can request to speak to all the following advisors:
§  Dignity Advisor   §  Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor   §  Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff)   §  Student Casework Team  §  Independent Sexual Violence Advisors  §  Student Support and Wellbeing

abuse

## 17.3 Information on Academic Representatives
Academic Representatives
Your Students’ Union is there to make sure you have the best possible time while you’re  studying at UCL. One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and  faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the  university works.

Every student at UCL will have a Course Representative or a Research Student  Representative who will be your eyes, ears, and voice. They’ll work closely with staff in  your department to make sure that they understand what you most value, and take action  to deal with things you’d like to see improve. They’ll also work with your Lead  Department Representative as well as your Faculty Representatives and the Students’  Union to make things better across the whole of UCL.
These Academic Representatives are appointed during early October – if you’d like to  take up the role, staff in your department can tell you how. If you take up a representative  role, the Students’ Union will work closely with you to provide training, support, and  advice, and you’ll be able to change the experience of everyone on your course or in  your department for the better.     Even if you don’t fancy taking up a role yourself, keep an eye out for your chance to vote  for which students you feel will do the best job.

Every department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at  least three times a year. Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic  Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students’ concerns, and prioritise  areas for improvement. SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.

## 17.7 Informal and Formal Student Complaints
17.7.1 Student Complaints
UCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL. However  we recognise that from time to time problems do arise and students may wish to express  concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.
17.7.2 Informal resolution
Many complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a  formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader,  Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student  Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak  to the Students’ Union’s Advice Service. UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution  and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before  making a formal complaint.
17.7.3 Formal complaints
If an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a  formal complaint using UCL’s Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that  all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without  fear of victimisation. The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties,  Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions. Students’ attention should be  drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.

## Feedback
Our goal is to put students’ feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision- making. We value students’ feedback and work with students as partners in the process  of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we  have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space –  including 1000 in the 24 hour new Student Centre, we’ve focussed more on  environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and  assessments.

#################################################################

## about the NSS,) Annual Programme Evaluations and New to UCL survey
Student Surveys
One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via  online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual  programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it’s about teaching,  accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about  what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an  excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes  to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.  Every piece of feedback is read and the results of each survey are shared with staff  across UCL – including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.

## 18.3 Module Dialogue – what is it and why it’s important
Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions,  on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff  ‘check-in’ with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects  such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This  provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive  feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and  ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module  before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.

#################################################################

## 18.4 UCL ChangeMakers
UCL ChangeMakers helps students and staff work in partnership to make education  better at UCL:
• Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on
enhancing education and students’ experience at UCL.  • Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through
student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised  through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.

• Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL
through the payment of a stipend.   • There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.
Projects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate  research (MRes).

20.1.1 Volunteering Services
The Volunteering Service at Students’ Union UCL exists to connect UCL students with  London’s Voluntary and Community Sector, primarily through volunteering. It’s one of the  largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have  access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not.
The Service runs three main programmes:  Partnerships - linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of  around 350 community partners.  Student-led Projects - supporting students to set up and run their own community  projects.  Community Research Initiative - connecting master’s students with community  organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form  their dissertations.
Through community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact  change in the wider world. UCL Student volunteers also report positive benefits on their  academic study and well-being.    [The Volunteering Service’s opportunities can be found on its online directory, where ](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering/directory) students can search for roles related to their academic studies, by skills developed or by  cause. There are plenty of one-off and flexible vacancies that students can fit around  their studies and other commitments.    Further Information

## 22.1 UCL Health, Safety and Security information
Health, Safety and Security at UCL
UCL’s overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for  staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an  integral part of the way in which UCL’s activities are managed and conducted.    There are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to  provide the safe and healthy environment:
1) UCL Security, who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to
lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours;  2) UCL Safety Services, who manage the safety management system including
providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive  samples;  3) UCL Estates who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing
contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators.     In an emergency:  Please call 020 7679 2222 or UCL extension 222 from any UCL phone, before ringing  999. This allows the security team to direct the emergency services to the correct  location.     If you are off the Bloomsbury campus, call 999 and request the appropriate service  (police, ambulance or fire brigade).    Safezone App:  SafeZone is an app available to all UCL students and staff to make it easier for you to  contact UCL Security directly from your mobile device. Landlines at UCL can still contact  security by dialling '222'.

# Assessment
This page contains departmental marking guidelines for individual items of assessment.  There may be additional criteria specified by module tutors; students should check  criteria for assessment in the module syllabus.

Mark  Grade  Description  >70  A (1st)  Distinction. Because this covers a range of thirty points, the following  breakdown has been introduced as a guideline:
A++ (85-100): Marks awarded to truly exceptional pieces of work.  Marks of 90 and above are reserved for research deemed to represent  full mastery of the subject, likely publishable in high-quality journal.
A+ (80-84): Satisfies all of the requirements for an ‘A’ grade (see  below), with additional originality, sophistication, or skill going beyond  what is expected.
A (75-79): Satisfies all of the requirements for an ‘A-’ grade (see  below), but also demonstrates originality, impressive original research,  higher critical ability, and a high degree of analytic/synthetic skills.  Goes significantly beyond lecture materials and course readings.
A-(70-74): Performs the assigned task to an excellent standard, with  accuracy and sufficient detail, without significant errors, no major  shortcomings. In an essay, a work in this range should use a good  number of appropriate sources, go beyond the material covered in  lectures, and demonstrate critical ability, analytic/synthetic skills, and  impressive research skills.  60-69 B (2i)  Good. Some critical thinking or reflection demonstrated. Many relevant  points made, clearly argued, accurate and coherent. Includes major  points in the course material and shows appreciation of their  importance.  50-59 C (2ii)  Satisfactory. A solid piece of work but with gaps, errors or minor  misconceptions.  40-49 D (3rd)   Poor. Inadequately argued and poorly documented. Provides some  relevant information but omits many important points and contains a  substantial number of errors or misconceptions. Little tie to relevant  sources. 40 – This is the minimum passing mark. Barely sufficient  evidence to avoid failure, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the  subject; contains irrelevant material or significant errors and  misconceptions.  0-39  F* (fail) Failure. Inadequate in conception, substance or argument.
F+ (35-39): A failing item, but one which could be brought to pass  standard if either more information was provided, or better use was  made of the information. When applied to whole courses, the student  may be eligible for referred (supplemental) assessment.
F (20-34): Contains some correct items of information not centrally  relevant to the topic.
F- (0-19): Completely inadequate in conception, substance and  argument. No understanding of the course material demonstrated.

Mark  Grade  Description
>70  A  Distinction. Because this covers a range of thirty points, the following  breakdown has been introduced as a guideline:  A++ (91-100): Marks awarded to truly exceptional pieces of work.  A+ (84-90): Satisfies all of the requirements for an ‘A’ grade, with  additional originality, sophistication, or skill going beyond what is  expected.  A (77-83): Satisfies all of the requirements for an ‘A-’ grade, but also  demonstrates originality, substantial or subtle critical accomplishment,  and substantial analytic, synthetic, and technical skills.  A- (70-76): Performs the assigned task to a high standard with accuracy  and sufficient detail, without significant errors or major shortcomings.  Demonstrates a comprehensive level of knowledge and ability to  synthesise an exceptionally wide range of materials. Distinctively  sophisticated and focused analysis, critical use of sources and insightful  interpretation. Outstanding ability to formulate a convincing and coherent  argument independently Excellent presentation and comprehensive  documentation.
60-69 B  Merit. Performs the assigned task to a very good standard. Most but not  all of the criteria satisfied for an A grade. Less evidence of originality,  critical thought and individuality.
50-59 C

Fair grasp of basic issues. Some, limited critical thinking or reflection  demonstrated. Many relevant points made, clearly argued, accurate and  coherent. Includes major points in the course material and shows  appreciation of their importance but fails to progress beyond routine  points.  Marks may have been deducted for: limited range and depth of reading;  tendency to summarise the work of others rather than to synthesise the  fruits of research into a discernible thesis; failure to maintain a  consistent narrative and/or argument throughout essay; generalisations  beyond the evidence offered; inadequate or inaccurate referencing; poor  grammar, punctuation and/or spelling.  50: minimum passing mark.
49-0  F  (fail)
Failure. Inadequate in conception, substance or argument. Shows a  poor familiarity with relevant information and an inability to synthesise  material from a range of sources. Demonstrates failure to use sources  and an inadequate ability to engage in systematic inquiry. Failure to  present a sustained, coherent and effective argument. Inadequate grasp  of appropriate principles of documentation and presentation.
